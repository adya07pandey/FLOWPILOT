# 🚀 Multi-Tenant SaaS Workflow & Operations Management Platform

A cloud-based SaaS platform that enables organizations to design workflows, assign tasks, manage approvals, and monitor execution through real-time dashboards and analytics.

This system separates **workflow design (blueprint)** from **workflow execution (runtime tasks)** and supports multi-tenant architecture where multiple organizations operate securely in the same system.

   ```js
   req.user = { userId, orgId, role }
